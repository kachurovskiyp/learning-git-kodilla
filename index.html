        <h1>Eminem</h1>
        <h2>Lose Yourself</h2>
        <p>“Lose Yourself” is the theme song from Eminem’s semi-biographical 2002 movie 8 Mile. Eminem is narrating the life of the film’s protagonist, Jimmy, up until the third verse, where Jimmy and Eminem’s journey converge.</p>

        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>
            Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity <br>
            To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment <br>
            Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo <br>
        </p>

        <h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
        <p>
            His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy <br>
            There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti <br>
            He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready <br>
            To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting <br>
            What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud <br>
            He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out <br>
            He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now <br>
            The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow <br>
            Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope <br>
            There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't <br>
            Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows <br>
            His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope <br>
            He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows <br>
            When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's <br>
            Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody <br>
            Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and <br>
        </p>
