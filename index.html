        <h1>Eminem</h1>
        <h2>Lose Yourself</h2>
        <p>“Lose Yourself” is the theme song from Eminem’s semi-biographical 2002 movie 8 Mile. Eminem is narrating the life of the film’s protagonist, Jimmy, up until the third verse, where Jimmy and Eminem’s journey converge.</p>

        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>
            Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity <br>
            To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment <br>
            Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo <br>
        </p>

        <h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
        <p>
            His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy <br>
            There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti <br>
            He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready <br>
            To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting <br>
            What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud <br>
            He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out <br>
            He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now <br>
            The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow <br>
            Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope <br>
            There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't <br>
            Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows <br>
            His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope <br>
            He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows <br>
            When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's <br>
            Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody <br>
            Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and <br>
        </p>

        <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
        <p>
            You better lose yourself in the music <br>
            The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go) <br>
            You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow <br>
            This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo <br>
            You better lose yourself in the music <br>
            The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go) <br>
            You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow <br>
            This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo <br>
            You better… <br>
        </p>

        <h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
        <p>
            His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping <br>
            This world is mine for the taking, make me king <br>
            As we move toward a New World Order <br>
            A normal life is boring; but superstardom's <br>
            Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder <br>
            Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over <br>
            These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows <br>
            He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads <br>
            God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father <br>
            He goes home and barely knows his own daughter <br>
            But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water <br>
            These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product <br>
            They moved on to the next schmoe who flows <br>
            He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera <br>
            Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner <br>
            But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah <br>
        </p>
        <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
        <p>
            You better lose yourself in the music <br>
            The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go) <br>
            You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow <br>
            This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo <br>
            You better lose yourself in the music <br>
            The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go) <br>
            You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow <br>
            This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo <br>
            You better… <br>
        </p>
        <h3>[Verse 3]</h3>
        <p>
            No more games, I'ma change what you call rage <br>
            Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged <br>
            I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed <br>
            I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage <br>
            But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher <br>
            Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper <br>
            All the pain inside amplified by the <br>
            Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to- <br>
            Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family <br>
            'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers <br>
            And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life <br>
            And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder <br>
            Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter <br>
            Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna <br>
            Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna <br>
            Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's <br>
            Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got <br>
            To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot <br>
            Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not <br>
            Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got <br>
            To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot <br>
            So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not <br>
            This may be the only opportunity that I got <br>
        </p>
        <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
        <p>
            You better lose yourself in the music <br>
            The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go) <br>
            You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow <br>
            This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo <br>
            You better lose yourself in the music <br>
            The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go) <br>
            You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow <br>
            This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo <br>
            You better… <br>
        </p>
        <h3>[Outro]</h3>
        <p>You can do anything you set your mind to, man</p>
